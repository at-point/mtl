ChangeLog
=========



Development 0.1.0
------------------

- Renamed `materializer` to `mtl`
- Added `materializer_header` helper function to render nice navbars
- REPLACE: vendored `_icons-material-design.scss` with local `_material-icons.scss`,
  that uses the embedded icon font and already contains the additional flags
- Added material-design-icon font from npm, to provide the icon font locally
